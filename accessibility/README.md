# Accessibility Implementation

This directory contains documentation and implementation details for accessibility features in the Gradiant platform.

## Overview

The Gradiant platform is committed to accessibility and aims to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. This section documents our approach to accessibility, known issues, and implementation guidelines.

## Documents

- [Developer Guide](./developer-guide.mdx) - Comprehensive guide for implementing accessible components
- [Known Issues](./known-issues.mdx) - Tracking document for accessibility issues and their resolution status

## Implementation

The accessibility implementation consists of several key components:

### 1. Component Tests

All UI components should include accessibility tests using the axe-core library. These tests check for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance at the component level.

Example:

```ts
it('should have no accessibility violations', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<Button>Click me</Button>);
  const results = await axe(container);
  expect(results).toHaveNoAccessibilityViolations();
});
```

### 2. End-to-End Tests

Playwright-based tests in the `tests/accessibility` directory test critical user flows for accessibility issues across multiple browsers and device types.

Tests include:

- Automated accessibility checks with axe-core
- Keyboard navigation tests
- High contrast mode testing
- Mobile device testing

### 3. Core Components

- `SkipLink` - Allows keyboard users to bypass navigation and go directly to main content
- `AccessibilityAnnouncer` - Provides screen reader announcements for dynamic content changes

### 4. Testing Utilities

The `src/utils/accessibilityTestUtils.ts` file contains helper functions for accessibility testing, including:

- Custom matchers for testing accessibility violations
- Functions for formatting accessibility errors with WCAG criteria
- Utilities for filtering violations by impact level

## Running Accessibility Tests

Run all accessibility tests:

```bash
pnpm run test:a11y:all
```

Component-level accessibility tests:

```bash
pnpm run test:a11y
```

End-to-end accessibility tests:

```bash
pnpm run test:a11y:e2e
```

## Key Implementation Principles

1. **Keyboard Accessibility** - All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
2. **Screen Reader Support** - All content must be available to screen readers
3. **Color Contrast** - All text must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
4. **Responsive Design** - All content must be accessible on mobile devices
5. **Form Accessibility** - All forms must have properly associated labels and error messages
