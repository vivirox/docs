# Deployment Guide

This guide covers how to deploy the Astro application to various environments.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure:

1. All tests pass (`pnpm test`)
2. The build completes successfully (`pnpm build`)
3. Required environment variables are set
4. Convex backend is deployed

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables should be set in your deployment environment:

```bash
# Convex
PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-convex-deployment.convex.cloud
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your-deployment-name
CONVEX_ADMIN_KEY=your-admin-key

# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET=your-auth-secret
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true

# Application
PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-site-url.com
```

## Deployment Options

### 1. Static Hosting (Recommended)

Astro supports static generation, which is the recommended approach for deploying this application.

#### Build for Static Hosting

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will generate a static site in the `dist/` directory, which can be deployed to any static hosting service.

#### Deploy to Vercel

```bash
vercel --prod
```

#### Deploy to Netlify

```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

#### Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
pnpm deploy
```

This runs a script that pushes the `dist/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.

### 2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

For dynamic content that needs to be generated at request time, use SSR deployment.

#### Build for SSR

Update `astro.config.mjs` to use the appropriate adapter:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import node from '@astrojs/node';

export default defineConfig({
  output: 'server',
  adapter: node({
    mode: 'standalone',
  }),
});
```

Then build the application:

```bash
pnpm build
```

#### Deploy to Vercel with SSR

Add a `vercel.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/server/entry.mjs"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then deploy:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

#### Deploy to Netlify with SSR

Create a `netlify.toml` file:

```toml
[build]
  command = "pnpm build"
  publish = "dist/"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/entry"
  status = 200

[functions]
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
```

Then deploy:

```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

### 3. Docker Deployment

For containerized environments, use Docker:

#### Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t your-app-name .
```

#### Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-convex-deployment.convex.cloud \
  -e CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your-deployment-name \
  -e CONVEX_ADMIN_KEY=your-admin-key \
  -e AUTH_SECRET=your-auth-secret \
  -e AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true \
  -e PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-site-url.com \
  your-app-name
```

#### Deploying with Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-convex-deployment.convex.cloud
      - CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your-deployment-name
      - CONVEX_ADMIN_KEY=your-admin-key
      - AUTH_SECRET=your-auth-secret
      - AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true
      - PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-site-url.com
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Convex Backend Deployment

Before deploying the frontend, you need to deploy the Convex backend:

1. Install the Convex CLI if you haven't already: `npm install -g convex`
2. Log in to Convex: `npx convex login`
3. Initialize a new deployment: `npx convex init`
4. Deploy the backend: `npx convex deploy`

Take note of the deployment URL and use it for your `PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` environment variable.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

### GitHub Actions

Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '22'

      - name: Install pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
        with:
          version: 10

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: Run tests
        run: pnpm test

      - name: Build
        run: pnpm build

      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
          vercel-args: '--prod'
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying, perform these checks:

1. Verify all pages load correctly
2. Test authentication flow
3. Check that Convex integration is working
4. Verify all interactive components function properly
5. Test responsiveness on different devices
6. Run Lighthouse audit for performance and accessibility

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are encountered after deployment:

1. For Vercel/Netlify: Use their dashboard to roll back to the previous deployment
2. For Docker: Restart the container with the previous image version
3. For Convex: Use `npx convex deploy --cmd rollback` to roll back to the previous deployment

## Performance Monitoring

Set up monitoring for your deployed application:

1. Add [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for error tracking
2. Set up [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/) for session replay
3. Configure [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) or [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Static assets not loading**: Check paths in the build output
2. **API calls failing**: Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. **Authentication issues**: Check Auth settings and secret keys
4. **SSR rendering errors**: Look for server logs in your hosting provider
