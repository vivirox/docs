# Risk Level Assessment System

## Overview

The Risk Level Assessment System provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and responding to potential security and mental health risks identified within the application. It combines sophisticated risk scoring with configurable alerting capabilities to ensure appropriate responses to potential crises.

## Key Components

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Risk Level Assessment Service**: Evaluates risk factors and determines appropriate risk levels
2. **Risk Alert System**: Manages notifications, escalations, and human oversight for high-risk situations
3. **Crisis Detection Integration**: Connects AI-based crisis detection with the risk assessment framework

## Risk Levels

The system uses four risk levels:

| Level | Description | Typical Response |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Low** | Minimal concern, routine monitoring | Passive monitoring only |
| **Medium** | Moderate concern, requires attention | Dashboard notification |
| **High** | Significant concern, requires intervention | Dashboard notification + Human review |
| **Critical** | Severe concern, requires immediate action | Dashboard notification + Human review + Optional escalation |

## Configuration Options

The risk assessment system can be configured with various sensitivity levels and thresholds:

### Sensitivity Levels

- **Low**: Higher thresholds for triggering alerts (more permissive)
- **Medium**: Balanced thresholds (default setting)
- **High**: Lower thresholds for triggering alerts (more cautious)

### Alert Channels

- **Dashboard**: In-app notifications (default)
- **Email**: Notifications to configured email addresses
- **SMS**: Text messages to configured phone numbers
- **Webhook**: HTTP POST to configured endpoints

## Implementation Details

### Risk Level Assessment Service

The `RiskLevelAssessmentService` evaluates various risk factors to determine an overall risk level. It uses a weighted scoring system that considers:

- Factor severity (0-1 scale)
- Factor confidence (0-1 scale)
- Critical factor amplification (1.5x weighting for critical factors)

```typescript
// Example usage
import { riskLevelAssessment, type RiskFactor } from '../../security/risk-level-assessment'

// Create risk factors
const factors: RiskFactor[] = [
  {
    type: 'suicidal_ideation',
    severity: 0.8,
    confidence: 0.7
  },
  {
    type: 'social_isolation',
    severity: 0.6,
    confidence: 0.8
  }
]

// Assess risk level
const assessment = riskLevelAssessment.assessRiskLevel(factors)

console.log(`Risk level: ${assessment.level}`)
console.log(`Requires intervention: ${assessment.requiresIntervention}`)
```

### Risk Alert System

The `RiskAlertSystem` manages notifications and human oversight for high-risk situations. It supports multiple notification channels and includes configurable cooldown periods to prevent alert fatigue.

```typescript
// Example usage
import { riskAlertSystem } from '../../security/alert-system'
import { riskLevelAssessment } from '../../security/risk-level-assessment'

// Process assessment through alert system
await riskAlertSystem.processAssessment(
  assessment,
  userId,
  'chat-message',
  {
    messageId: '123456',
    sessionId: '789012'
  }
)
```

### Human Oversight

For high and critical risk levels, the system ensures human review through:

1. Flagging cases in the dashboard
2. Storing detailed information in the database
3. Optional real-time notifications to designated responders
4. A review interface for clinical staff to assess and respond to alerts

## Security Considerations

- All risk assessment data is stored securely with strict access controls
- Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest
- The system follows privacy regulations by minimizing data collection
- Access to high-risk alerts is limited to authorized personnel only

## Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

The system includes robust error handling and fallback mechanisms:

- If risk assessment fails, it defaults to a medium risk level
- If alert delivery fails through the primary channel, it attempts alternate channels
- All errors are logged for review and system improvement
- Periodic audits ensure system reliability and accuracy

## Best Practices for Implementation

1. **Regular Calibration**: Periodically review and adjust sensitivity levels based on false positive/negative rates
2. **Human in the Loop**: Always maintain human oversight for high and critical risk levels
3. **Documentation**: Keep clear records of all alert responses for quality improvement
4. **Privacy Focus**: Collect only necessary information needed for risk assessment
